## Description

To dynamically and quickly create a quality README, Inquirer NPM was utilized to:

- Generate command-line questions to the user.
- The user input was gathered and added as markdown to a pre-written README.MD in their appropriate README sections.

## Installation

1. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules? and .DS store. This ensures that the node_modules directory isn't
   tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
2. Use the command-line, npm install, to install Inquirer NPM.
3. To start answering questions to write the README, use the command, node index.js.

## Usage

- Inquirer NPM is used to prompt the user to provide information regarding their GitHub projected to create their
  README.
- fs.writeFile is used to render the markdown to a pre-written README.MD.
- Once the user's information regarding which license is used:
  - A badge for the appropriate license will be added using the information from https://shields.io/.
  - The license text will be printed in the License section exported from the getLicense.js function and file.
- A clickable table of contents is created based on the user's provided info.
- The user's GitHub profile and email are added to the Questions section as a clickable links.
